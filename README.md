## Project idea

A trivia game website for educational use, primarily for students in elementary school or high school.

## Project background/Business Opportunity
When we were brainstorming ideas for this project, the one we came across that we liked the most was making a trivia game in a web browser. The goal will be to create a visual interface where questions will be prompted to the user and they will be provided with multiple choice answers to pick from. They will gain points on correct answers and if the wrong answer is selected the right answer will be shown to the user before moving on to the next question. The goal will be for the website to have a simple design so that it is easily navigate able by children or adults alike. This can be implemented to help young students enjoy learning. It can be very hard for students, especially young students, to enjoy and commit to studying what they are learning in school. With a resource like this trivia game where it turns learning and studying into a game it will appeal more to a younger audience. This will make students more eager or at least more tolerant of expanding their school learning. It will provide a much more entertaining platform for exploring different topics such as science, history, and math than reading a book ever will. We believe that itâ€™s possible to make this an engaging platform to help encourage young students to pursue education and further their learning. This is also an opportunity to introduce a new way for teachers to reinforce the learning of their students. It will be a fun and intriguing way for teachers to spice up learning in their classrooms and keep students engaged.
