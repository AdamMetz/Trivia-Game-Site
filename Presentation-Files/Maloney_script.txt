Intro:  

Hi, my name is Quinn Maloney. My role in developing math blitz was designing and creating the controller 

Why: 

The target audience for math blitz is elementary school students as well as elementary school teachers. 
We created it to be a tool that students could use to improve their mental math skills in a game format. 
This could be used by students at home outside of school or could also be used as a way for teachers to 
add more variety to their math class by making math more of a game and have it appeal more to their students. 

 

MVC Architecture: 

This is the diagram we created before we started developing math blitz. We found it was helpful when we were 
in the planning stage and early development stage for getting a good idea of how our website would function 
and how the different elements will talk to each other. Since we all worked on separate parts of the website it 
also helped us establish responsibilities as well as how we have to connect our individual pieces once they were 
completed. 

 

Reflection: 

Overall, as a team we felt really good about the final product of this project. We definitely see it as a successful 
project. We really liked that we were able to accomplish all of the goals we had initially set at the start of the 
project planning phase and we believe that alone would count this as a success but are satisfied we went a bit further. 

 

What did I learn and will use: 

Moving forward I will also be using some of the planning documents such as the roles and responsibilities chart and the 
RACI table as we found it kept us organized.
