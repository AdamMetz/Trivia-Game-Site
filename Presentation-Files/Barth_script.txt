Role
I'm Taishi Barth. I worked on the back end and created the question generator for the project,
which represents the model.

Planning Docs
Before even thinking about code, we had project planning documents to formalize what exactly the
project was going to be. One of the things they did was to make our original project idea into a
potential product, which ended up giving the project a better direction. We got a better idea of
what the base MVP should be and what future MVPs might have. The documentation also split us into
our roles for the project and overall made the team more organized.

UML Diagrams
To visualize how our project would work, we created a bunch of UML diagrams. An example would be
the sequence diagram on the left. That one shows how our target customer, in this case a student,
interacts with the product. That one was pretty simple, so it might not have been as useful. On the
otherhand, we have the data flow diagram on the right. That one shows how data flows between 
different parts of the project, which was useful for generalizing the structure of our code.

Reflection - What made the team proud?
The obvious thing that made us proud was that we got something working and it's usable. Another
thing is that we managed to finish our initial MVP early, so we had time to do another. The
current functionality is also something we thought was nice.

Reflection - The future
For the future, I feel that there is a lot that would be relevent for working in a real work
environment, even if that doesn't use something like AGILE. Stuff like the planning documents,
kanban board, and the UML diagrams all seem useful to use in the future.
