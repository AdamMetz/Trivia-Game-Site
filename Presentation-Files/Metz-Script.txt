INTRO

Hello everyone,
Our team name is Team Data, and the project we have created is called MathBlitz
So for starters going over the team members and roles, 
I'm Adam Metz and I primarily worked on the Front-end of the project, and primarily the view of the MVC



IDEA

Alright so going over the idea of our project, it initially started as a general trivia site for educational use.
But we found that overall that this scope was too broad and we recieved similar feedback from our first meeting with the prof.
So we even refined the scope twice, tightening it down to elementary level students, and only math problems
This leaves us at the final 'idea' that is MathBlitz, which is a site that generates dynamic sets of math problems meant for elementary level students to practice on



KANBAN
The Kanban board was one of the next step of project planning and primarily the user stories it contained,
The User Stories that we came up with and discussed as a team were useful for getting a good idea of what functionalities we envisioned as a team for the site, 
and what functionalities the users would require for using the site.
As well this board was very useful for keeping our tasks organized, and helped us to see where each team member was at with their progress for each deliverable or MVP


MVPS
The last portion of our project planning was planning out our MVPs and refining them
The first MVP we had planned was a fully functional implementation of the site, with support for accounts, quesiton/answer generation, a review of the questions after they were completed, and a profile view
The second MVP was mostly touchups such as login/signup feedback for incorrect entries, touchups to clipping and what not in the UI, and improvements to the question generation algorithm.
And the third MVP, was a last MVP if we had time, where we would touch up things such as the responsiveness of the site, and additional math operations.
And especially a big part of the third MVP was improving the overall enjoyability of the game.


FEEDBACK
And the reason I say this was a big component of the third MVP, was due to the feed back we got from other students in the class.
It was unanimous from all the feedback, that we should try to implement some sort of game mechanics/better scoring system to make the game a more enjoyable experience.
Although this did affect our planning for our third MVP, we unfortunately never got to implementing the third MVP as we did not have the extra time to do so.

REFLECTION

For me, if I happen to do much front-end development in the future, I would definately plan to use Adobe XD again, its a UI design tool that I used for designing the website, and it was very easy to use, 
and I think the design turned out quite well
